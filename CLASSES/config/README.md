# Config File Editor Class

This class was created to edit configuration files with ease and allows for you to keep your mind on your project, rather than finding ways to edit files. This class allows to read a setting line, get setting value and edit setting value, it also allow you to edit the setting name and to delete a setting line, and finally also append setting lines to the end of the configuration file.

Users:
The class can be directly copied into the project and used.
List of functions can be found in document.md.

Known issues:
Note that this class was developed on a Unix system and may not work correctly on other systems.
There is currently no error handling.

Usage:
I claim this as my original work, but do not discriminate on how it may or may not be used.
